# Jet energy corrections

In the new versions of the 2018 PbPb forests, the jet energy corrections are included already in the forest. However, in the old forests this is not the case. If you want to do the jet energy corrections manually, that can happen using these files. The files in this folder are downloaded from:

https://github.com/cms-jet/JECDatabase/tree/master/textFiles

With the latest corrections found from the folders:

- PbPb data: https://github.com/cms-jet/JECDatabase/tree/master/textFiles/Autumn18_HI_V8_DATA
- PbPb MC: https://github.com/cms-jet/JECDatabase/tree/master/textFiles/Autumn18_HI_V8_MC
- pp data: https://github.com/cms-jet/JECDatabase/tree/master/textFiles/Spring18_ppRef5TeV_V6_DATA
- pp MC: https://github.com/cms-jet/JECDatabase/tree/master/textFiles/Spring18_ppRef5TeV_V6_MC
