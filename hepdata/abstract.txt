Modifications of high transverse momentum $(p_{\mathrm{T}})$ jets in the quark-gluon plasma are studied via correlations between jets and charged particles in dijet events in PbPb and pp collisions. Only back-to-back leading and subleading jets are used for correlations, which are measured in relative pseudorapidity and relative azimuth from the jet axis. The events are categorized in bins of collision centrality, charged particle $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ and dijet momentum balance $x_{j}$, which is the ratio between subleading and leading jet $p_{\mathrm{T}}$. By measuring charged particle yields as a function of relative pseudorapidity with respect to leading and subleading jet axes as well as the jet momentum density profiles ("jet shape"), we observe a larger modification for the leading jet in a more balanced configuration, while for subleading jets the opposite is observed.
